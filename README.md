# Telco-Churn-Classification-Project
**GOAL**:

This python code analyzes data of a fictional telco company that provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. The goal is build a classification model that could predict if a customer will churn or not. Below are the questions that was helpful in understanding the data.

* What is the overall count of churn value?
* What is the count of male vs. female by churn value?
* What is the churn value count by contract type?
* Is there a relationship between churn value and monthly charges?
* What's the most popular payment method?
* Do more people enroll in device protection?
* How many  people  go paperless?
* What are the top 5 reasons why customers churn?
* What is the most correlated factor to churn value?

**FINDINGS**:
* Females and males seem to churn at about the same rate. Customers with monthly contracts and people with higher monthly charges seem to be more prone to leaving.

* Electronic checks is the most popular payment method for the customers of this company. Most people who have internet services do not enroll in device protection. Most people choose paperless billing.

* The top 5 churn reasons according to the customers by order of number of respondents:
  
   Attitude of support person
  
   Competitor offered higher download speeds
  
   Competitor offered more data
  
   Don't know
  
   Competitor made better offer

 **Description**:
  * Data Exploration
  * Data Visualization, ansswering the questions above
  * Data preprocessing: filling empty strings with numbers, changing categorical data to numerical.
  * Train-Test Split and Scaling of Data.
  * Model 1: Log model
  * Model 2: KNN model
  * Model 3: SVM model
  * Final Model: Read the notebook to find out ðŸ˜„
  * Predictions with final model
